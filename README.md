<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

* Authentication:
The authentication feature enables users to create an account, login, and manage their credentials securely. It includes functionalities such as user registration, login/logout, password reset, and authentication token management. Users can access protected resources and perform actions based on their authorization level..

*   User Management:
The user management feature allows administrators to manage user accounts, roles, and permissions. It includes functionalities such as creating user profiles, updating user information, enabling or disabling user accounts, and assigning appropriate roles and permissions.

*   Category and Subcategories:
The category and subcategories feature organizes products into a hierarchical structure. It enables the creation, retrieval, update, and deletion of categories and subcategories. Products can be associated with one or multiple categories, allowing users to browse and filter products based on their category preferences.

*    Product Management:
The product management feature enables administrators to manage the products available in the e-commerce platform. It includes functionalities such as adding new products, updating product details (e.g., name, description, price, images), managing inventory levels, associating products with categories and subcategories, and enabling/disabling products.

*  Cart Management:
The cart management feature allows users to add products to their shopping cart, update quantities, remove items, and calculate the total price. It provides functionality to persist the cart data across sessions, allowing users to resume their shopping experience at a later time.

*  Brand Management:
The brand management feature enables administrators to manage brands or manufacturers associated with the products. It includes functionalities such as creating new brands, updating brand details (e.g., name, logo), associating brands with products, and providing brand-related information to users.

*   Order Management:
The order management feature, as described in the previous response, allows users to place orders, manage their orders, and track the status of their purchases. It includes functionalities such as order placement, order history, order status tracking, inventory management, order confirmation, and communication.

* Coupons and Discounts:
The coupons and discounts feature provides functionality to create and manage promotional offers, discounts, and coupons. It includes functionalities such as creating coupon codes, specifying discount rules or conditions, applying discounts to orders, and validating coupons during the checkout process.

*   Review Management:
The review management feature allows users to leave reviews and ratings for products they have purchased or used. It includes functionalities such as submitting reviews, rating products, retrieving reviews, and displaying average ratings. Users can also interact with reviews by commenting on them or marking them as helpful.

*  Error Handling:
The error handling feature ensures that the API handles errors gracefully by providing appropriate error messages and responses. It includes handling validation errors, authentication errors, database errors, and other exceptional scenarios. Meaningful error messages are returned to users, facilitating troubleshooting and improving the user experience.

* Validation:
The validation feature ensures that user input and data received by the API are validated against predefined rules and constraints using Joi. It includes input validation for various fields, such as checking for required fields, data types, length restrictions, and format validations. By leveraging the power of Joi, the e-commerce API project ensures data integrity, enhances security, and improves the overall reliability of the system by validating user input..

*  Pagination:
The pagination feature allows users to retrieve a subset of data from large collections. It enables efficient data retrieval by dividing the results into pages and providing mechanisms to navigate through the pages. Pagination enhances performance and user experience, especially when dealing with a large number of products or search results.
